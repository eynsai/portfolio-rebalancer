# portfolio-rebalancer

This script helps you rebalance investment portfolios. 

It can handle:
- Rebalancing across multiple accounts
- Constraints on per-account and total contributions
- Optimization of taxable capital gains

Currently, it only supports the use of the Questrade API. I'd like to refactor the script to be compatible with multiple brokerage APIs and data input methods via interchangable backends.

## Usage

### Linux

`./start.sh`

### Windows PowerShell

`.\start.ps1`
